# Guitar-Fretboard-With-Java
Java console app that generates a guitar fretboard graphic with locations of the C major scale 


Context: I wanted to learn more with Java but within my personal goals of doing more with the guitar practicing app.
Action: I created a program that prints out a visual representation of a guitar fretboard with the location of notes from a desired scale.
Result: I have a big piece of the guitar practicing app established with this project.
Reflection: This part of the app still needs to be integrated with other parts; but getting this much accomplished was a lot of fun, very inspiring, and helped make java my preferred language to learn and excel in.
